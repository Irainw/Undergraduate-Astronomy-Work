Before we do any tests, let's let the system know the device...
  Device 1 ( b'LMS-152D' ) has serial number 14881
  Frequency = 0.25  GHz
  Sweep start frequency = 0.25  GHz
  Sweep end frequency = 1.5  GHz
  Sweep time = 1.0  seconds
  Power level = 12.0  db
  Pulse on time = 9.999999747378752e-05  sec.
  Pulse off time = 0.0005000000237487257  sec.
  Minimum frequency = 0.25  GHz
  Maximum frequency = 1.5  GHz
  Midpoint frequency =  0.625  GHz above the min
  Set frequency to  0.875  GHz.
